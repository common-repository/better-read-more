== Description ==

Use WordPress built-in <!--more--> tag to hide text on pages.

This is particularly handy for a mobile site using pages with extrememly large content. This content will let you put a "more" link in the page and will then insert a javascript more button in the page itself which will show and hide the remainder of the content on the page. 

Can be used with any theme, including sites that use multiple themes for mobile/desktop and it works with <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/any-mobile-theme-switcher/">Any Mobile Theme Switcher</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Unzip
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Select the theme and other options under Settings->Better Read More
